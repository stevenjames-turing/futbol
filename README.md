# Futbol


## About

- Welcome to Futbol! This application parses data from a fictional soccer league in the form of three CSV files. Modules and classes were created to output game, league, season, and team statistics.

## Getting Started
  - Fork/Clone this repo to your computer from GitHub
  - [Futbol](https://github.com/stevenjames-turing/futbol)

  ## Testing:
	- If you'd like to run through our test suite just use the rspec spec/<file_name> on any of the spec files.
	- There is also a pre-built [spec-harness](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/futbol_spec_harness) for this application.
	- We've also used SimpleCov to ensure our tests have full coverage.
	- To run the Simplecov report type the following into your terminal: open coverage/index.html
	- See details here: [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)
	- There are tests to make sure each individual method is in working order, as well as the methods in stat_tracker that bring several together.
